## Technology Stack used for the project
Our technology stack consists of Render, PostgreSQL, Express/node.js, and Handlebars/Bootstrap.

## Prerequisites to run the application - Any software that needs to be installed to run the application
NPM and its dependencies as well as Docker need to be installed to run the application locally. Otherwise, the user can simply click the Render link, no installations are necessary.

## Instructions on how to run the application locally.
In order to run the application locally, NPM must be installed on the local machine, and the node dependencies must be installed by typing 'npm install' into the command line under the ProjectSourceCode directory. Additionally, Docker must be used to run the application from our container.

## How to run the tests
To run the tests, the docker-compose.yaml command must be changed to 'npm run testandrun' and the API's must be altered to send the proper response to the test cases.

- Update release notes in Github: ie "We implemented X, Y, Z features. This is the first release of the product." and mention what is and isn't working so far

- After docker-compose.yaml is working, send Barghav an email with a demo (by the end of the week or early next week if possible)

- Demo can be at minimum a modified version of lab 8 with working login/register pages

- Make sure to assign roles on the Project Board

- Focus on getting the basics running on the application, then work with Bhargav on external API calls

- Next week's agenda: 
Gavin - updating databases and API routes
Ryan - API routes/calls
Kaythy - outfit design feature and cohesive frontend theme for all pages
Elizabeth - create partials and work on wishlist and save features
